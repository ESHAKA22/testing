    I don't care
    What they do
    I just wanna
    Be with you
    And I don't mind
    All the times
    We will fight
    Just to get through (yeah)
    Yeah, 'cause all these empty faces
    They got nothin' on yours
    They got nothin' on yours
    They got nothin' on yours, and yeah
    All the brightest places
    They turn dark when you're gone
    They turn dark when you're gone
    They turn dark when you're gone
    You got that hometown smile
    You got that look in your eyes
    That says "Oh, every-thing will one day be alright"
    You got that hometown smile
    You got that look in your eyes
    And I'll do anything just to keep you by my side
    All through my life (life)
    I finally realized
    That home is not (not)
    Where you go (where you go)
    'Cause now I need (now I need)
    Only you and me (you and me)
    And wherever we'll be ('ever we'll be)
    We'll never get lost
    Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-na
    Yeah, 'cause all these empty faces
    They got nothin' on yours (they got nothin' on yours)
    They got nothin' on yours (they got nothin' on yours)
    They got nothin' on yours
    They can keep on talkin' baby
    You're the beat through the noise
    You're the beat through the noise
    You're my beat through just noise
    You got that hometown smile
    You got that look in your eyes
    That says "Oh, everything will one day be alright"
    You got that hometown smile
    You got that look in your eyes
    And I'll do anything just to keep you by my side
    By my side
    You got that hometown smile
    You got that look in your eyes
    That says "Oh, everything will one day be alright"
    You got that hometown smile
    You got that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
    And I'll do anything just to keep you by my side
    Everything will one day
    Everything will one day
    Everything will one day be alright
    Everything will one day
    Everything will one day
    Everything will one day be alright
