    Currently studying in 3rd year of Information Technology specialization at SLIIT.I have  a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, particularly through my work with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Additionally, my knowledge of Java, C++, Android studio,HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has enabled me to build robust and user-friendly web applications.
    Beyond coding, I have enhanced my technical competencies by completing an AWS Cloud Computing Essentials course. These experiences have sharpened my ability to build and maintain scalable, cloud-native applications.
     My proactive approach to tackling complex challenges and collaborating effectively with diverse teams makes me a strong fit for this role.
